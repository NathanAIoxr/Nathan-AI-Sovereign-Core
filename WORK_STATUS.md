# TABOR 1-2-3 FACTORY™ — LIVE BUILD STATUS

**Updated:** 2026-10-14 (documentation reconciliation; prior test results retain their original dates)  
**Public GitHub repository:** NathanAIoxr/Nathan-AI-Sovereign-Core  
**Status rule:** A page, specification or button does not establish a working provider integration. Move a feature to `working` only with an end-to-end test/result.

| Feature | State | Evidence / next step |
|---|---|---|
| **2026-10-10 system audit** | **verified local and public check baseline** | [Full repair audit](app-factory/SYSTEM_AUDIT_2026-10-10.md); 8 private ZIP baseline suites retested, 103 tests passed; publicly committed quality workflow verifies selected Factory browser modules |
| Public ecosystem directory | browser prototype | `app-factory/ecosystem.html`, curated `products.json`; does **not** disclose the unreleased private idea/asset catalog |
| Core permissions / data reference contract | library only | `app-factory/core/root-contracts.js`, independently unit tested; **not** real authorization or login |
| App-specific PWA manifests | implemented, device QA pending | ONE, TABOR GPS and 1420 have separate app start URLs; test installing on iPhone |
| Data-integrity/offline repairs | public browser prototypes | Vault large-file unverified IDs, blank GPS input check, restricted offline cache and direct links; **full original-byte ZIP backup/restore now implemented with CRC/SHA-256 unit tests**; mobile Safari QA and cloud backups still pending |
| GitHub repo and version control | working | Repo writable through connected ChatGPT GitHub tool |
| Master Build Order Controller | public prototype | `app-factory/build-order/` dependency graph: 39 shared capabilities/product families, deterministic ordering, reuse flags and approval gates; repeatable Node tests |
| Creator Vault full-byte backup | public prototype | `app-factory/vault-backup.js`; local ZIP export+restore includes original media bytes and SHA-256 integrity, with numbered ~95 MB download batches; individual over-limit originals require separate download; physical iPhone QA still required |
| Public static Factory PWA | prototype | `app-factory/index.html`; verify GitHub Pages current deployment |
| Universal Creator Vault | prototype | `app-factory/vault.html` and `vault.js`; per-browser IndexedDB and manual import |
| Story Blueprint | prototype | Browser form generates a story outline, not full AI manuscript |
| Role Atlas | prototype | 135 preliminary records, many sources not verified |
| AI Project handoff | prototype | Manual JSON and public demo feed only |
| Media AI | not-started | UI plans provider modes/costs; generation API absent |
| Real secure accounts + tenants | not-started | Auth/RLS/db required |
| Cloud private asset storage + backup | not-started | Data backend, private buckets, versions/ACL required |
| Recurring authorized third-party sync | not-started | OAuth, webhooks/jobs, consent; providers not connected |
| Actual cloud iOS/Android build | blocked | Expo app and account/signing configuration |
| App Store submission | blocked | Old Apple Developer membership issue + signing/review |
| Google Play submission | blocked | Google Play developer access and native build |
| Payment gateway | not-started | Static WHO + WHAT router and batch manifest planner now exist; real payment gateway remains unimplemented |
| Angels vs. Demons 404 | prototype | Private source ZIP/roster supplied in Work package; tests run locally |
| ONE MATRIX/GAME OF LIFE | prototype | Private Python/HTML prototype; numerical canon reconciliation needed |
| Healers & Protectors | concept | Replaces Maters & Taters as core game; original art in private package |
| TaborTales | concept | Character/story/mount-basin/school vertical slice specified; original art in private package |
| Work handoff | working | Public `WORK_BUILD_HANDOFF.md`, detailed private ZIP prepared in chat |

| 1420: The Crowning Jewel | prototype | `app-factory/games/crowning-jewel.html`; two playable campaigns, cross-century archive, 12 self-tests passing; no complete production game yet |

| 101–901 Root Constellation | prototype | Public local JSON importer, private ZIP of 496 new concepts / 101 original games / 150 prior records; secure hosted registry not connected |

| ONE — The Last App | browser prototype with E Health module (QA pending) | `app-factory/one/` retains A–Z shell and DO commands; `app-factory/one/health/` adds encrypted local import, recovered ZIP/source preservation, bath notebook, recovery timeline, portable export and importer tests. **No private health files in public GitHub; user has not yet imported sources in their browser; no HealthKit/provider access.** |

| Nathan AI LET/TET/PPL | prototype | Independent v2 Python package in private conversation ZIP; 14 passing unit tests, original PPL source recovered; no trained AI or live model API yet |

| Universal State Engine | prototype | Private working FastAPI/SQLite/JS/Unity-reference ZIP; 15 passed tests; development-only owner header, NOT production auth |

| TABOR GPS | prototype | `app-factory/tabor-gps/index.html` and `gps.js`; 11 calculation checks passed, no turn-by-turn routing or real magnetic model |

| REMOVE JC | playable local alpha | Private browser + optional Node/SQLite zip; 90 Atlas topics, 6 acts, 18 missions, original artwork and 12-second teaser, 27 passing tests; not deployed as full 3D game or online service |

| Knowledge & Creation Engine | local private prototype | 44 tests passed; DOCX/XLSX/PPTX import/export; SQLite FTS5 + graph + versioning + SHA-256 original-byte backup; no live Graph OAuth or model inference. Public handoff `app-factory/knowledge-engine/README.md` |

**Work's task:** Update this document after each milestone with exact tests, URLs/PRs, blockers, and account approvals. Do not claim an outside action completed based on plan text alone.

## October 14, 2026 — continuity and current source index

[Latest creative continuity notes](app-factory/creative/continuity/2026-10-14.md) preserve Round 1, KINETICS/TIME, the Middle C body map, Great Samaritan ethics, the latest Merlin novel canon and writing/visual concepts. [Structured notes](app-factory/creative/continuity/2026-10-14.json) retain explicit statuses. This is a summarized intake, not a complete original-source archive.

| Feature | State | Source evidence / remaining work |
|---|---|---|
| 376-position game reference explorer | existing reference browser | Six source archives; 138-position subset retained. [Reference Lab](app-factory/game-reference-lab/README.md); not 376 implemented games |
| Dynamic Pricing & Audience Router | existing static preview and manifest planner | [Pricing Router](app-factory/pricing-router/README.md); no live billing |
| Middle C — Axis of Infinity | existing browser game prototype | [Middle C](app-factory/middle-c/README.md); finite curated material with deterministic indexed levels |
| Middle C — HO ↔ OH | existing browser game with bundled iPhone resources | [Polar branch](app-factory/stewie-mr-finn/polar-middle-c/README.md); store release and physical-device QA not established here |
| Ancient Divine Roots | existing source archive | [293 rows / 35 sections](app-factory/mythology/ancient-roots/README.md); historical verification pending |
| KNAVE | existing source archive and original fictional characters | [117 indexed rows](app-factory/mythology/knave/README.md); cultural/linguistic claims remain verification-pending |
| October 14 creative continuity | documentation and structured notes | Round 1 and latest novel/body-map corrections recorded; no new gameplay or generated image import in this update |

Verification for this documentation update: checked existing repository source at commit `65dc19fc3a9c5ed144e4858c585cc199f436fc47`, validated new JSON and relative documentation links. No application code changed; earlier test counts above are historical results, not reruns in this update.

## October 20, 2026 — ONE E / 301 Health & Recovery branch
- New Health & Recovery module under ONE, NOT a standalone app; main ONE page has a link to the E domain module.
- Secure-on-device design: explicit ZIP / document picker and AES-256-GCM encrypted IndexedDB originals. Source bytes and original filenames are never put into public commits.
- Recovered personal health ZIP files still require the owner to import them from their trusted device. Source counts in recovered archives are not a declaration of imported data.
- New private authored bath and recovery notes, SHA-256 duplicate checks, portable user-triggered export and reimport. Clinical, creative and engineering claims remain separate.
- Tests added to CI. Status remains **browser prototype / QA pending**, not an EHR, native provider integration, or production medical device.
- Documentation: [ONE Health README](app-factory/one/health/README.md).
