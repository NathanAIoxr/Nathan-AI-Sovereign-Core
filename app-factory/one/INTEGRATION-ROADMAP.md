# ONE APP — Continuous Integration of Creations

**Owner:** Nathan Tabor  
**Canonical project:** `app-factory/one/` — ONE — The Last App  
**Parent ecosystem:** NATHAN AI → TABOR ROOT → TABOR 1-2-3 FACTORY  
**Development principle:** CREATE ONCE. TRANSFORM INTO EVERYTHING. PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL.

## Imported now
1. `modules/a-vs-i/index.html` — exact preserved playable v6 browser build, including A vs I / Angels vs. Inbreds match-3, 13 realms, 101 documented angel roster entries, math core, animation backend, rig/timeline/particle and sprite atlas tools.
2. `modules/barnabas/index.html` — **Helplessness & Barnabas** project workspace. Records user-authored central thesis `without barnabus there is NO paul`, the ONE/TWO body-design analogy, Acts 9 and Acts 11, and separate local draft editor/export. Full unpublished manuscripts and 101 interventions are *not* claimed to be imported.
3. `module-registry.json` — manifest for future modules and their distinct status, storage and provenance.
4. `index.html` — new Creations launch section; existing ONE A–Z, tasks, events, ZERO mode, providers, DO bar and consent boundaries preserved.
5. `one.js` — user-triggered DO aliases for A vs I, Animation Forge and Barnabas.

## Integration contract
- ONE is a user-controlled shell, not a renaming of TABOR WORLD or the Factory.
- Each module is distinct and can be developed independently; it is not duplicated as a fresh competing app.
- Local saves stay in each module's own browser storage (same-origin route paths may share an origin; namespaced keys are required).
- Do not publish private writing, source archives, personal information, images, account records, or manuscripts without owner review.
- No accounts, AI model services, cloud backup, OS-level controls, or payment services are implied to be connected.
- Game narrative, religious texts, interpretation and documented history retain separate evidence labels.
- The A vs I v6 original source remains independently available for checksum/source comparison.

## Running
- From the Factory: `app-factory/index.html` → ONE — The Last App.
- From ONE: `app-factory/one/index.html` → Creations.
- Game: `app-factory/one/modules/a-vs-i/index.html`.
- Book: `app-factory/one/modules/barnabas/index.html`.
- DO commands: `open a vs i`, `open animation forge`, `open barnabas`.
- Tests: `node app-factory/one/one.test.cjs` and `node --test app-factory/one/integration.test.cjs`.

## Next integration cycles
- Authored work source import: preserve bytes/revisions and authorship, then attach to ONE Creator Vault with explicit user-scoped grants.
- Animation backend: migrate animation engine into reusable Factory / TABOR ROOT package without breaking gameplay.
- Content: link verified books, TaborTales, Healers & Protectors and other modules through an opt-in registry, preserving each original.
- Production: test with local web servers, cross-device performance benchmarks, audit game saves, backups, offline PWA strategy, accessibility and GPU fallback.
- Publishing: run CI, review PR, and obtain owner authorization for release to public website / app stores.

**Known boundary:** The module launcher and local author workspace are connected on this branch; they are not a production sync service or a merged app-store build.
